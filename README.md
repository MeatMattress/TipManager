# TipManager
Tip calculator &amp; Statistics viewer for Lowcountry Produce Market &amp; Cafe
This web-application was created for the servers of Lowcountry Produce. The servers pool tips at this establishment, and had no formal means of calculating their personal tips, and seeing statistics on those tips.
This application solves both of those issues. By employing a MongoDB database, a Node.Js server, and local javascript, servers may enter tip information and quickly accomplish necessary tasks.
